    <p>
      A hearty bowl of mushroom soup is a meal in itself, but this dish pairs
      well with many other foods. Crispy baked chicken or a peppery skirt steak
      would both make good partners for this top-rated recipe. Or, serve cream
      of mushroom soup with crisp, tangy salad to cut through the richness. Any
      way you serve it, Chef John's savory offering will keep you coming back
      for more.

    <h3>Ingredient Measurements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, tied in a bundle with kitchen twine</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup water, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves for garnish, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and 1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired.</li>
        <li>Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, to remove the raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme bundle.</li>
        <li>Purée soup with a blender in batches until smooth and thick.</li>
        <li>Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.</li>
    </ol>
