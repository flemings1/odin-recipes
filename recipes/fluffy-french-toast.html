      This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses
      flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better
      than the French toast they usually make! This fluffy French toast recipe
      is crisp on the outside, but perfectly soft and tender on the inside. The
      secret ingredient in this fluffy French toast recipe: all-purpose flour!
      Flour binds the liquids together, which creates a more traditional
      “batter” and helps prevent soggy results. This extra ingredient ensures
      the French toast is crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy on the
      inside.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This fluffy French toast batter starts with 1/4 cup all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Milk adds moisture and richness to the batter. You can substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk if you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Of course, you'll need eggs for French toast! Three eggs bind the batter together and give it a rich texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A tablespoon of white sugar lends welcome sweetness to this decadent breakfast recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> A teaspoon of vanilla extract adds complexity and takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Ground cinnamon lends coziness and warmth.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make your French toast taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread:</strong> You'll need 12 slices of your favorite thick-sliced bread. Good choices include brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah.</li>
    </ul>
